# Loan Calculations - User Guide

## 🎯 What's New?

SmartFinHub now automatically calculates and displays important loan metrics to help you better manage your loans:

1. **EMI (Monthly Payment)** - See your exact monthly payment amount
2. **Accrued Interest** - Track how much interest has accumulated on your loan

---

## 💰 EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)

### What is EMI?

EMI is your fixed monthly payment for a loan. It includes both principal repayment and interest charges.

### Where You'll See It

✅ **When Creating a Loan** - See EMI before you save
✅ **On Accounts Page** - View EMI for each loan
✅ **On Dashboard** - Quick overview of all loan EMIs

### How It Works

**Automatic Calculation:**
- Enter your loan principal (amount borrowed)
- Enter interest rate
- Enter loan tenure (months)
- **EMI calculates instantly!**

**Example:**
```
Loan Amount: $300,000
Interest Rate: 6.5% per year
Tenure: 360 months (30 years)

Your EMI: $1,896.20/month
```

### What Affects Your EMI?

1. **Loan Amount** ⬆️ Higher amount = Higher EMI
2. **Interest Rate** ⬆️ Higher rate = Higher EMI
3. **Loan Tenure** ⬆️ Longer tenure = Lower EMI (but more total interest)

### Tips for Using EMI

✅ **Before Taking a Loan**
- Use the EMI calculator to see if you can afford the monthly payment
- Try different loan amounts and tenures to find what works for you

✅ **Managing Existing Loans**
- Check your EMI on the Accounts page
- Compare EMI across different loans
- Plan your monthly budget around your EMIs

✅ **When Rates Change**
- For floating rate loans, EMI updates automatically when rates change
- Monitor your EMI to see the impact of rate changes

## 📈 Accrued Interest

### What is Accrued Interest?

Accrued interest is the total interest that has accumulated on your loan from the start date until today. It shows how much interest you've incurred so far.

### Where You'll See It

✅ **On Accounts Page** - Displayed prominently on each loan card
✅ **On Dashboard** - Quick view of accrued interest for all loans

### How It's Calculated

The system automatically calculates accrued interest based on:
- **Loan start date** - When your loan began
- **Outstanding balance** - Current amount you owe
- **Interest rate history** - All rate changes over time
- **Time elapsed** - Days from start to today

### Why It Matters

**Financial Awareness:**
- See exactly how much interest you're paying
- Track interest costs over time
- Understand the true cost of your loan

**Rate Change Impact:**
- For floating rate loans, see how rate changes affect your interest
- Compare interest before and after rate changes
- Make informed decisions about refinancing

### Example Scenario

**Your Home Loan:**
- Start Date: January 1, 2024
- Loan Amount: $300,000
- Initial Rate: 6.5%

## 📊 Understanding Your Numbers

### EMI Breakdown

Your EMI consists of two parts:

1. **Principal Repayment**
   - Portion that reduces your loan balance
   - Increases over time

2. **Interest Payment**
   - Portion that goes to the lender
   - Decreases over time

**Early in Loan:**
- More of EMI goes to interest
- Less goes to principal
- Example: $1,896 EMI = $1,625 interest + $271 principal

**Later in Loan:**
- More of EMI goes to principal
- Less goes to interest
- Example: $1,896 EMI = $271 interest + $1,625 principal

### Interest Rate Impact

**Small Rate Changes = Big Impact**

Example with $300,000 loan over 30 years:

| Rate | Monthly EMI | Total Interest |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 6.0% | $1,799 | $347,515 |
| 6.5% | $1,896 | $382,633 |
| 7.0% | $1,996 | $418,527 |

**0.5% increase = $100/month more = $36,000 more over 30 years!**

### Accrued vs Total Interest

**Accrued Interest:**
- Interest accumulated so far
- From start date to today
- What you've paid/owe currently

**Total Interest:**
- Interest over entire loan life
- From start to final payment
- What you'll pay eventually

**Example:**
- Loan: $300,000 at 6.5% for 30 years
- After 1 year:
  - Accrued Interest: ~$19,400
  - Total Interest (projected): $382,633
- You've paid 5% of total interest so far

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### About EMI

**Q: Why does my EMI change when I update the interest rate?**
A: EMI is calculated based on the current interest rate. When the rate changes, the monthly payment amount changes to maintain the same loan tenure.

**Q: Can I change my EMI?**
A: EMI is calculated automatically. To change it, you would need to adjust the loan amount, interest rate, or tenure.

**Q: Is the EMI shown the exact amount I'll pay?**
A: Yes, it's the calculated monthly payment based on your loan terms. However, your actual payment might include additional fees or charges from your lender.

**Q: Why is my EMI different from what my bank told me?**
A: Small differences can occur due to:
- Different calculation methods
- Processing fees not included
- Rounding differences
- Insurance or other add-ons

### About Accrued Interest

**Q: Why is my accrued interest so high?**
A: Interest accumulates daily on your outstanding balance. Over time, even small daily interest adds up to significant amounts.

**Q: Does accrued interest include interest I've already paid?**
A: Yes, it's the total interest from the loan start date to today, whether paid or unpaid.

**Q: Why did my accrued interest jump after a rate increase?**
A: The system recalculates using the new higher rate. The jump reflects the increased interest cost going forward.

**Q: Can I reduce my accrued interest?**
A: You can reduce future interest by:
- Making prepayments to reduce principal
- Refinancing to a lower rate
- Making extra payments

### About Calculations

**Q: How often do calculations update?**
A: Calculations update:
- Instantly when you change loan details
- Automatically when you update interest rates
- Daily for accrued interest (based on current date)

**Q: Are the calculations accurate?**
A: Yes, we use industry-standard formulas. However, always verify with your lender for official amounts.

**Q: What if I have multiple rate changes?**
A: The system tracks all rate changes and calculates interest for each period separately, then sums them up.
