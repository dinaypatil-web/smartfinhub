## 🎓 Financial Concepts

### Cash Flow Statement Definition
A financial statement showing how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, breaking the analysis down to operating, investing, and financing activities.

### Why Cash Flow Matters
- Revenue ≠ Cash: You might have income but not cash
- Liquidity: Shows if you have enough cash for obligations
- Health: Positive operating cash flow indicates financial health
- Planning: Helps predict future cash needs

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why is my closing balance different from my account balance?**
A: The opening balance is calculated from account balances at report generation time, not at the start of the month. For accurate month-end reconciliation, compare the closing balance with your actual account balance on the last day of the month.

**Q: Are loan accounts included in the opening balance?**
A: No, loan accounts are liabilities (money you owe), not assets. They're excluded from opening/closing balance calculations but loan payments are tracked in Financing Activities.

**Q: What if a month has no transactions?**
A: The cash flow statement will still show, with all activity categories at zero, and closing balance equal to opening balance.

**Q: Can I compare multiple months?**
A: Currently you can view one month at a time, but you can switch between months to compare. Future versions may include multi-month comparisons.

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Monthly Review**: Check your cash flow statement on the last day of each month
2. **Trend Analysis**: Keep notes on high/low cash flow months for planning
3. **Budget Correlation**: Compare against your budget to identify variances
4. **Debt Tracking**: Monitor financing cash flow to track debt paydown progress
5. **Operating Focus**: Ensure operating cash flow is positive for financial health
