- **Tax Purposes**: Have accurate dates for tax filing

### Tips

✅ **Use the actual disbursement date** - This is when you received the loan funds, not when you applied

✅ **Keep documentation** - Save your loan agreement to verify the date

✅ **Be accurate** - The start date affects interest calculations
